@0    = ~Apparently Irlentree and Zorl want to throw an anniversary party for Aldeth. When we told him about it, he told us that he has no anniversary.~
@1    = ~We considered that. We want to work with you. We're not Aldeth's childhood friends. He's hired us to scout Zorl's and Irlentree's machinations.~
@2    = ~An anniversary celebration? What nonsense! What are these two planning?~
@3    = ~If they prepare a celebration for Aldeth, we must anticipate their plan which probably looks to complete soon. We should expect that they mean to harm Aldeth.~
@4    = ~We need to hurry! Find out what the two are planning exactly - as soon as possible!~
@5    = ~Hmm, as you wish, but hurry!~
@6    = ~All right. Then we will leave again.~
