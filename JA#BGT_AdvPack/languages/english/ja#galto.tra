@0    = ~ 'Allo, me friends. You've the look of the well-armed wanderer, which means you *burp* either do the fool's work of dungeon slumming or the easy labor of the blade-and-night man. Aye! Either way, you've items you've liberated from their previous owners. I can help you on that point. If you've something a touch too "known" for a store to buy, I'll take it off your hands—at a slightly reduced figure, of course.~

@1    = ~I see. Then show me what you have.~
@2    = ~I don't do business with fences. Farewell.~
@3    = ~There you are again, my friends! Uh - *burp* - do you have something to sell that better wouldn't come near the guards?~
@4    = ~That's the reason I'm here. Let's see.~
