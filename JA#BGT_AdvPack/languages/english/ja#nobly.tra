@0    = ~I swear it's not what it looks like. I had this dream I did, where I was lost in a strange land. Frozen with fear I was, because I couldn't take more 'n two steps at a time. I lost my life to a ferocious rabbit, and a flock of people came from nowhere to steal my pants. And then I woke up here. Honest. Don't tell the missus.~
@1    = ~Aaaah, where am I?~
@2    = ~Waaaaah! Ooh, I thought you were this rabbit...~
@3    = ~Bohoo! This Black Lotus really packs a punch!~
